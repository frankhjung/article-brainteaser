I first saw this puzzle in [CSIRO](https://www.csiro.au/)'s [Double
Helix](https://doublehelixshop.csiro.au/)
[here](https://blog.doublehelix.csiro.au/a-magic-triangle-brainteaser/).

The problem we are solving is described as:

Given a triangle with circle on each point and on each side:

![Magic Triangle](triangle.jpeg)

Using the numbers from 1 to 6 then arrange them in a triangle with three numbers
on each side. Swap them around until the sides all add up to the same number.

Finally, sum each side to 10.

## Solution

Using Haskell to solve this problem into parts:

  - get all permutations of numbers 1 to 6 as `a, b, c, d, e, f`

  - filter permutation to satisfy conditions

    - `a + b + c == c + d + e == e + f + a`
    - and final condition: `a + b +c == 10`

All permutations of numbers 1 to 6:

```haskell
import Data.List

permutations [1..6]
```

_This will give `6! = 720` permutations._

Filter on sides summing up to same:

```haskell
[ [(a,b,c), (c,d,e), (e,f,a)] | [a,b,c,d,e,f] <- permutations [1..6],
    a+b+c == c+d+e && c+d+e == e+f+a ]
```

Which gives all solutions where the sides are equal sums:

```text
  [
  [(3,2,5),(5,4,1),(1,6,3)],
  [(2,4,3),(3,5,1),(1,6,2)],
  [(1,5,3),(3,4,2),(2,6,1)],
  [(1,4,5),(5,2,3),(3,6,1)],
  [(5,3,4),(4,2,6),(6,1,5)],
  [(6,2,4),(4,3,5),(5,1,6)],
  [(4,5,2),(2,3,6),(6,1,4)],
  [(6,3,2),(2,5,4),(4,1,6)],
  [(2,3,6),(6,1,4),(4,5,2)],
  [(4,1,6),(6,3,2),(2,5,4)],
  [(3,4,2),(2,6,1),(1,5,3)],
  [(1,6,2),(2,4,3),(3,5,1)],
  [(5,4,1),(1,6,3),(3,2,5)],
  [(4,3,5),(5,1,6),(6,2,4)],
  [(6,1,5),(5,3,4),(4,2,6)],
  [(3,6,1),(1,4,5),(5,2,3)],
  [(5,2,3),(3,6,1),(1,4,5)],
  [(2,6,1),(1,5,3),(3,4,2)],
  [(3,5,1),(1,6,2),(2,4,3)],
  [(1,6,3),(3,2,5),(5,4,1)],
  [(5,1,6),(6,2,4),(4,3,5)],
  [(2,5,4),(4,1,6),(6,3,2)],
  [(6,1,4),(4,5,2),(2,3,6)],
  [(4,2,6),(6,1,5),(5,3,4)]
  ]
```

Filter on sides summing to 10:

```haskell
[ [(a,b,c), (c,d,e), (e,f,a)] | [a,b,c,d,e,f] <- permutations [1..6],
    a+b+c == c+d+e && c+d+e == e+f+a && a+b+c == 10 ]
```

Which gives our final list of solutions:

```text
  [
  [(3,2,5),(5,4,1),(1,6,3)],
  [(1,4,5),(5,2,3),(3,6,1)],
  [(5,4,1),(1,6,3),(3,2,5)],
  [(3,6,1),(1,4,5),(5,2,3)],
  [(5,2,3),(3,6,1),(1,4,5)],
  [(1,6,3),(3,2,5),(5,4,1)]
  ]
```
